The source for this extractors are the repos from zildjian4life218 and rahoulrdhopade. I standardized them to OSSEM Plain model, reduced the number and made some cosmetical improvements.
Tested on Graylog 6.3.1 and SFOS 21.5. 
Hope that version will come handy to eliminate normalizing in pipelines.
